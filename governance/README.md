# Governance

1. [organization](organization) directory contain a top-level organizational governance and polices for a technical steering committee (TSC).
2. [project](project) directory is for an individual project governance, subject to the polices and oversight of the larger organization.

## Why would we want to use this?

Minimum Viable Governance allows to start an organization and sub-projects with simple governance in place at the outset - including legal terms, licensing and trademark issues, and due process.
Having this governance in place early helps avoid disputes among participants down the road.

## How do we use this?

1. Organization's mission described in Section 1 of the [CHARTER.md](organization/CHARTER.md) file.
2. The TSC memebers are listed in [STEERING-COMMITTEE.md](organization/STEERING-COMMITTEE.md).
3. Each project under organization's governance, has a repository where maintainers are listed in the [MAINTAINERS.md[project/MAINTAINERS.md] file.
